10:04 AM - Caffeine Bot: idea for the armor
10:04 AM - Caffeine Bot: since making it like factorio would involve a lot of custom stuff
10:05 AM - Caffeine Bot: but we still want depth in how you layout the upgrades how bought adjacency bonuses
10:05 AM - Caffeine Bot: armor capacitors? low capacity but burst hard idk
10:06 AM - Caffeine Bot: only bonds one one side but as u get better tiers it buffs more adjacent slots
10:07 AM - Caffeine Bot: next to a power source it charges faster  next to shield unit you get a bonus to discharge rate
10:07 AM - Caffeine Bot: nanobots that repair armor?
10:08 AM - Caffeine Bot: cloaking ofc
10:08 AM - Caffeine Bot: upgrade point costs for balance
10:08 AM - Caffeine Bot: with power reqs
10:09 AM - Caffeine Bot: unless u have a btter idea i vote for adjacency bonuses
10:09 AM - Caffeine Bot: works best with the basic slot based inventories we have to work with
10:10 AM - Caffeine Bot: high throughput emergency caps but they dump at full rate even if not all utilised
10:11 AM - Caffeine Bot: maybe a heat mechanic? o.0
10:11 AM - Caffeine Bot: might be getting to complex there
10:11 AM - Caffeine Bot: oh ya instead of upgrade points have it be heat
10:12 AM - Caffeine Bot: cause power armor can cook you
10:12 AM - Caffeine Bot: additional cooling upgrades but they take physical room maybe give em bonuses if you put em inadvantagious slots
10:13 AM - Caffeine Bot: like put it here u get better cooling but then it messes with ur power layout a bit
10:14 AM - Caffeine Bot: maybe power srcs batteris and caps
10:14 AM - Caffeine Bot: batteries have moderate cap and discharge and have variable drain
10:15 AM - Caffeine Bot: caps low cap discharge fast in emergency like catastrophic damage events like creepers and discharge at full rate?
10:15 AM - Caffeine Bot: smart armor that panics and reinforces shielding :3
10:15 AM - Caffeine Bot: require sensor kits for that kind of functionality
10:16 AM - Caffeine Bot: so u can decide u want brute force or slimmer and smarter
10:16 AM - Caffeine Bot: prolly varies on ur situation and expected combat
10:16 AM - Caffeine Bot: if u cant tell I'm REALLY into power armor
10:16 AM - Caffeine Bot: Halos armor makes me squeel like a child
10:18 AM - Caffeine Bot: have raw ablative armor on top of shielding can jusst make it have durability and provide in game armor
10:19 AM - Caffeine Bot: make it give less protection as it degrades making the self repair more useful
10:19 AM - Caffeine Bot: ofc putting to much stuff in burns you...
10:19 AM - Caffeine Bot: baking damage \o/
10:20 AM - Caffeine Bot: shielding eats fire dmg of cause shielding...
10:20 AM - Caffeine Bot: poison idk
10:21 AM - Caffeine Bot: motors that make u hit harder
10:21 AM - Caffeine Bot: jump higher take less fall dmg
10:21 AM - Caffeine Bot: sheilding eats fall dmg would give the shield bursting a use
