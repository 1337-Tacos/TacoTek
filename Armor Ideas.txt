Reduce fall damage- slime / bounce instead.
Solar Panels have durability?

Module- nanobots that repair armor?
Module- cloaking
Module- Shock back (percent chance of shocking the person who hit you.)
Module- Super advanced helm plating alloys (take next to no damage in helm area)




but we still want depth in how you layout the upgrades how bought adjacency bonuses
armour capacitors? low capacity but burst hard idk
only bonds one one side but as u get better tiers it buffs more adjacent slots
Caffeine Bot: next to a power source it charges faster  next to shield unit you get a bonus to discharge rate
unless u have a better idea i vote for adjacency bonuses
high throughput emergency caps but they dump at full rate even if not all utilised
batteries have moderate cap and discharge and have variable drain
caps low cap discharge fast in emergency like catastrophic damage events like creepers and discharge at full rate?


maybe a heat mechanic? o.0
oh ya instead of upgrade points have it be heat
cause power armour can cook you
additional cooling upgrades but they take physical room maybe give em bonuses if you put em inadvantageous slots
like put it here u get better cooling but then it messes with ur power layout a bit



require sensor kits for that kind of functionality

shielding eats fire dmg of cause shielding...
poison idk
motors that make u hit harder
jump higher take less fall dmg
shielding eats fall dmg would give the shield bursting a use
